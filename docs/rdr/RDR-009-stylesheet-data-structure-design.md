# RDR-009: Stylesheet Data Structure Design

## Metadata
- **Type**: Architecture
- **Status**: draft
- **Priority**: P2
- **Created**: 2026-03-15
- **Related**: RDR-008 (F6), Kramer-4k0

## Problem Statement

Kramer's layout pipeline uses mutable fields on `SchemaNodeLayout` (and its sealed subtypes `PrimitiveLayout`, `RelationLayout`) to carry state across three pipeline phases: **measure**, **layout/compress**, and **build**. The paper (Bakke 2013 §3.5) describes a three-phase pipeline where each phase produces an immutable result consumed by the next, with a stylesheet providing configurable properties.

Currently Kramer has ~20 mutable fields across the hierarchy, mixed between data-dependent, width-dependent, and derived classifications. There is no schema path abstraction, no stylesheet data structure, and no separation of phase results. This makes it difficult to reason about state, debug layout issues, or extend the system.

This RDR addresses the 6 design questions identified in RDR-008 F6.

---

## Question 1: Schema Path Abstraction

### Current State

No path abstraction exists. Schema nodes are identified by field name (`getField()`), which is used as:
- CSS style class for JavaFX nodes
- Key for style caches in `Style` (F7 cache uses field name)
- Layout cache key (F8 cache uses `SchemaNode` object identity)

Field names are unique within a single JSON object but NOT unique within a schema tree — nested relations can reuse field names at different levels (e.g., `root.items.items`).

### Proposed Design

Introduce `SchemaPath` as a lightweight value type:

```java
public record SchemaPath(List<String> segments) {
    public SchemaPath(String... segments) {
        this(List.of(segments));
    }

    public SchemaPath child(String field) {
        var extended = new ArrayList<>(segments);
        extended.add(field);
        return new SchemaPath(List.copyOf(extended));
    }

    public String leaf() {
        return segments.getLast();
    }

    public String cssClass() {
        return leaf(); // CSS class uses leaf name (backward compatible)
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return String.join("/", segments);
    }
}
```

**Usage**: Built incrementally during `measure()` traversal. Each `SchemaNodeLayout` stores its `SchemaPath`. The stylesheet maps `SchemaPath` → property overrides.

**Backward compatibility**: `cssClass()` returns the leaf field name, preserving existing CSS behavior. The path is additive — old code that uses `getField()` continues to work.

## Question 2: LayoutStylesheet Interface

### Current State

Style properties are distributed across three classes:
- `PrimitiveStyle` — 7 configurable properties (maxTablePrimitiveWidth, variableLengthThreshold, outlineSnapValueWidth, verticalHeaderThreshold, minValueWidth, plus label/list insets)
- `RelationStyle` — 10+ configurable properties (outlineMaxLabelWidth, outlineColumnMinWidth, bulletText/Width, indentWidth, maxAverageCardinality, plus insets from 8 JavaFX regions)
- `Style` — CSS stylesheet list, style factory methods, layout observer

Properties are set programmatically via setters or derived from CSS. There is no per-path override mechanism.

### Proposed Design

```java
public interface LayoutStylesheet {
    /**
     * Get a property value for a schema path, with fallback to defaults.
     * Property names follow CSS convention: e.g., "max-table-primitive-width".
     */
    double getDouble(SchemaPath path, String property, double defaultValue);
    int getInt(SchemaPath path, String property, int defaultValue);
    String getString(SchemaPath path, String property, String defaultValue);

    /**
     * Convenience: get the full PrimitiveStyle for a path.
     * Returns default style with per-path overrides applied.
     */
    PrimitiveStyle primitiveStyle(SchemaPath path);

    /**
     * Convenience: get the full RelationStyle for a path.
     */
    RelationStyle relationStyle(SchemaPath path);
}
```

**Implementation**: `DefaultLayoutStylesheet` wraps the existing `Style` object and its CSS-derived styles. Per-path overrides are stored in a `Map<SchemaPath, Map<String, Object>>`. The `primitiveStyle()` and `relationStyle()` methods return cached style objects with overrides applied.

**Phase property distinction**: Not needed at the stylesheet level. Properties are declarative (e.g., "max-table-primitive-width = 350"). The pipeline phases read properties; they don't write them. Phase-specific computed state (data widths, cardinalities) stays on the layout objects, not the stylesheet.

## Question 3: Call Site Inventory — Mutable Field Catalog

### SchemaNodeLayout (base, 6 mutable fields)

| Field | Type | Phase Set | Classification | Reset by clear() |
|-------|------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| `columnHeaderIndentation` | double | nestTableColumn | Width-dependent | Yes |
| `columnWidth` | double | measure | Data-dependent | No |
| `height` | double | cellHeight, adjustHeight | Derived | Yes |
| `justifiedWidth` | double | compress, justify | Width-dependent | Yes |
| `labelWidth` | double | measure | Schema-dependent | No |
| `rootLevel` | boolean | autoLayout (temporary) | Pipeline flag | No |

### PrimitiveLayout (7 mutable fields + 4 inherited)

| Field | Type | Phase Set | Classification | Reset by clear() |
|-------|------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| `averageCardinality` | int | measure | Data-dependent | No |
| `dataWidth` | double | measure | Data-dependent | No |
| `isVariableLength` | boolean | measure | Data-dependent | **No** (intentional) |
| `maxWidth` | double | measure | Data-dependent | No |
| `cellHeight` | double | cellHeight | Derived | No |
| `useVerticalHeader` | boolean | nestTableColumn | Width-dependent | Yes |
| `style` | PrimitiveStyle | constructor | Immutable | — |

### RelationLayout (11 mutable fields + 4 inherited)

| Field | Type | Phase Set | Classification | Reset by clear() |
|-------|------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| `averageChildCardinality` | int | measure | Data-dependent | No |
| `cellHeight` | double | compress, cellHeight | Derived | No |
| `children` | List\<SNL\> | measure | Schema+Data | No |
| `columnHeaderHeight` | double | columnHeaderHeight (lazy) | Derived | Yes |
| `columnSets` | List\<CS\> | compress | Width-dependent | No |
| `extractor` | Function | fold (during measure) | Data-dependent | No |
| `maxCardinality` | int | measure | Data-dependent | No |
| `resolvedCardinality` | int | cellHeight | Derived | No |
| `tableColumnWidth` | double | nestTableColumn | Width-dependent | Yes |
| `useTable` | boolean | layout | Width-dependent | Yes |
| `style` | RelationStyle | constructor | Immutable | — |

**Total: 24 mutable fields** (6 base + 7 primitive + 11 relation), not ~50 as originally estimated.

### Classification Summary

- **Data-dependent** (9): Set in `measure()`, persist across layout/compress. These capture the data distribution (widths, cardinalities, variable-length classification).
- **Width-dependent** (7): Set in `layout()`/`compress()`/`nestTableColumn()`. Change when available width changes. Reset by `clear()`.
- **Derived** (6): Computed from other fields during `cellHeight()`, `columnHeaderHeight()`. Could be computed on-demand.
- **Schema-dependent** (1): `labelWidth` — same for same schema.
- **Pipeline flag** (1): `rootLevel` — temporary, set/unset within `autoLayout()`.

## Question 4: Interactive Resize Path

### Current Architecture Already Supports This

The current code **already separates measurement from layout**:

```
AutoLayout.resize(width)
  └─ autoLayout(data, width)
     ├─ if (layout == null) → measure(data)   // ONLY on first call or stylesheet change
     └─ layout.autoLayout(width, ...)          // Always runs
        ├─ layout(width)      // determines table vs outline
        ├─ compress(width)    // distributes width
        ├─ calculateRootHeight()
        └─ buildControl()     // creates JavaFX nodes
```

The `layout` field persists across resizes. Only the width-dependent fields (7 of 24) are recomputed. The data-dependent fields (9 of 24) survive from the original `measure()` call.

### Immutable Phase Result Model

An immutable model would formalize this existing pattern:

```java
// Phase 1 result — produced by measure(), consumed by layout()/compress()
record MeasureResult(
    double labelWidth,
    double columnWidth,
    double dataWidth,
    double maxWidth,
    int averageCardinality,
    boolean isVariableLength,
    List<MeasureResult> childResults  // for RelationLayout
) {}

// Phase 2 result — produced by layout()+compress(), consumed by buildControl()
record LayoutResult(
    double justifiedWidth,
    double height,
    boolean useTable,
    List<ColumnSet> columnSets,      // for outline mode
    double tableColumnWidth,         // for table mode
    List<LayoutResult> childResults
) {}
```

**Migration path**: The `MeasureResult` record would replace the 9 data-dependent mutable fields. The `LayoutResult` record would replace the 7 width-dependent + 6 derived fields. The layout methods would return these records instead of mutating `this`.

### Impact on Resize

With immutable phase results:
- `measure()` → `MeasureResult` (cached, reused across resizes)
- `layout(width, measureResult)` → `LayoutResult` (recomputed per width)
- `buildControl(layoutResult)` → `LayoutCell` (recomputed per width)

This is structurally identical to the current architecture but makes the data flow explicit.

## Question 5: Migration Strategy

### Recommendation: Incremental (3 phases)

**Phase A: Extract MeasureResult** (LOW risk)
1. Create `MeasureResult` record for `PrimitiveLayout`
2. Have `measure()` populate both the record AND existing fields (dual-write)
3. Gradually migrate readers from fields to record
4. Remove mutable fields once all readers use the record
5. Repeat for `RelationLayout`

**Phase B: Extract LayoutResult** (MEDIUM risk)
1. Create `LayoutResult` record
2. Have `layout()`/`compress()` populate both record and fields
3. Migrate `buildControl()` and `cellHeight()` to read from record
4. Remove mutable fields

**Phase C: Introduce LayoutStylesheet** (MEDIUM risk)
1. Create `DefaultLayoutStylesheet` wrapping existing `Style`
2. Add `SchemaPath` to layout objects during measure
3. Wire stylesheet property lookups through `LayoutStylesheet` interface
4. Add per-path override support
5. Migrate programmatic style setters to stylesheet API

**Why not big-bang**: The sealed hierarchy (`SchemaNodeLayout permits PrimitiveLayout, RelationLayout`) means all changes to the base class affect both subtypes. Incremental migration with dual-write avoids breaking the pipeline while in-flight. Each phase can be validated with the existing 142-test suite.

**Phase ordering**: A → B → C. Each phase is independently shippable. Phase C is optional — the system works with just A+B (immutable results) without the stylesheet interface.

## Question 6: Interaction with F1-F5 Changes

### All F1-F5 changes are independent of F6

| Feature | What it changed | F6 interaction |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| F1 (maxTablePrimitiveWidth) | Default value on `PrimitiveStyle` | None — property stays on PrimitiveStyle, accessed via stylesheet in Phase C |
| F2+F3 (column sets) | Deferred | None |
| F4 (outlineSnapValueWidth) | New property on `PrimitiveStyle`, logic in `compress()` | None — compress reads from style, F6 doesn't change this |
| F5 (variableLengthThreshold) | Moved constant to `PrimitiveStyle` | None — already on style object, will route through stylesheet |
| F7 (style cache) | HashMap in `Style` | Phase C subsumes this — stylesheet caches styles internally |
| F8 (layout cache) | IdentityHashMap in `Style` | Phase A makes this cleaner — MeasureResult is immutable, no stale-state risk |

**Key insight**: F1-F5 moved configuration FROM code TO style objects. F6 would move it one step further: FROM style objects TO a stylesheet data structure. The direction is consistent; no rework needed.

---

## Risks and Considerations

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Dual-write bugs during migration | Medium | Extensive test suite (142 tests) catches regressions |
| Performance regression from record allocation | Low | Records are value types, allocated on stack in many cases. Profile after Phase A. |
| `isVariableLength` lifecycle complexity | Medium | This field intentionally survives `clear()`. MeasureResult makes this explicit — it's part of the measure result, not mutable state. |
| LayoutStylesheet API design may be premature | Medium | Phase C is optional. Phases A+B deliver the core benefit (immutable results) without the stylesheet API. |
| Sealed hierarchy constrains refactoring | Low | Only 2 concrete subtypes. Changes are manageable. |

## Success Criteria

1. MeasureResult record captures all 9 data-dependent fields
2. LayoutResult record captures all 13 width-dependent + derived fields
3. `clear()` method eliminated or trivial (no mutable state to reset)
4. Resize path provably doesn't re-measure (same as today, but explicit)
5. All 142 existing tests pass at each migration phase
6. `isVariableLength` lifecycle is explicit in MeasureResult, not a comment

## Recommendation

Proceed with incremental migration (Phases A → B → C). Phase A (MeasureResult extraction for PrimitiveLayout) is the natural starting point — it affects the simpler class with fewer fields, and the `isVariableLength` lifecycle issue makes the benefit immediately tangible.

Phase C (LayoutStylesheet) should be deferred until after A+B are complete and validated. The per-path override capability is useful but not urgently needed.
